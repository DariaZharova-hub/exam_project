    <h1>Examination project</h1>
    <p> The goal of the project is to create a website for one of the cities in Latvia. I have choosen Pinki.</p>
    <p>The goal of my project will be to create a simple website with pictures and useful information. For example, in <a href="https://www.pinkudraudze.lv/">Piņķi there is St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church</a>, which was built in the 19th century.
